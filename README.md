# admin-dashboard

This project aims to build a comprehensive dashboard design using grid layout to efficiently organize visual elements. The dashboard will feature a collection of my previous projects, which, while basic, represent significant milestones in my learning and professional development journey. Through this dashboard, I intend not only to showcase my progress over time but also to highlight the skills and knowledge gained from past projects.
